# List of Indian Companies with sectors

I NEED THE COMMUNITY'S HELP IN ORDER TO MAKE A COMMONLY REFERENCEABLE DATABASE OF COMPANIES OF INDIA AND THEIR SECTORS.

I found that the data is very discrete and the sectors are not standard.

Thus I will be making the updates in the "Industry" & "Notes" columns to match the sectors with the NSE standard sectors.

**PLEASE HELP ME BY RAISING PULL REQUESTS FOR YOUR SUGGESTIONS/CHANGES**
